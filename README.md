## Updates

Last Update:  10/19/19

What was Updated:  I've drastically changed the landing page aboutme section, and will continue to remodel this to better reflect my prefered artistic vision of a personal porfolio site.  The original assigment was completed successfully, but without any of projects linking to my actual work.  In te future, I will likely create an entirely unique personal page, seperate from this assignment.

## Assignment Details

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout.

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

## Problems

The bootstrap framework is extremely user-friendly.  The only problems I had were getting familiar with the syntax that bootstrap uses to specify their styling.  However, the easy solution to this is to simply check out their documentation, as it is very easy to understand, and they provide tons of examples.
